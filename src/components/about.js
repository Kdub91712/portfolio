                        <p>I've been in software development for 7 years.  I'm most experienced in LAMP stack technologies, APIs and Integrations.</p>
                        <p>PHP is my strongest language, but I'm really enjoying working with Python and React.  In my spare time I like to work on app ideas and trying new technologies.</p>
